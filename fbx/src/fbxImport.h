/// \ingroup usdfbx
/// \brief Import FBX data into a USD data cache.
///
/// **Settings**: Units and coordinate system map well between both formats, the plugin reads what's
/// in the FBX and writes it to the USD. The default in FBX is cm, and +y up axis.
///
/// **Materials**: The plugin reads all file textures from the FBX and caches them. Then it reads
/// all materials from the FBX and maps their parameters to their USD counterparts, where textures
/// might be mixed together. Particularly, a phong to PBR conversion might take place. It then
/// writes the resulting textures and materials to USD.
///
/// **Nodes and Skeletons**:
/// TODO: refactor skeletons. Currently doing:
/// 1. Import all FBX nodes, whether joint or not, into the USD node hierarchy.
/// 2. Also import FBX joints into corresponding USD skeletons.
/// 3. Instantiate USD skeleton and mesh at the node where a skinned mesh is instantiated in fbx.
///
/// Instead we should not import as USD nodes those FBX nodes that act as joints.
///
/// **Other**: The plugin traverses the node hierarhcy to import all other objects. (TODO change via
/// GetSrcObject on the scene)
