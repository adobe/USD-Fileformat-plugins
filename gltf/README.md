## Translation Notes

**Import:**

|Material Import|
|--|
UsdPreviewSurface with specular workflow = off
baseColorFactor OR baseColorTexture[rgb] → diffuseColor
emissiveFactor OR emissiveTexture[rgb] → emissiveColor
normalTexture[rgb] → normal
occlusionTextureFactor → occlusion
metallicFactor OR metallicRoughnessTexture[b] → metallic
roughnessFactor OR metallicRoughnessTexture[g] → roughness
baseColorTexture[a] if MODE is not OPAQUE → opacity
alphaCutoff if MODE is MASK → opacityThreshold

During material import, the ASM shading model is used as an intermediate transport layer.

Anisotropy
- Anisotropy Strength to ASM Level:
  - Formula:
    - Step 1: ASM Level = √√(strength² × (1 - roughness²))
  - Description:
    - Calculates the ASM anisotropy level by squaring the strength, scaling it by the roughness, and then taking the fourth root of the result.

- Anisotropy Rotation to ASM Rotation:
  - Formula:
    - Step 1: normalized_angle = angle / (2 × PI)
    - Step 2: ASM Rotation = normalized_angle - floor(normalized_angle)
  - Description:
    - Normalizes the rotation angle by dividing by 2π and ensures it wraps within the [0, 1] range by subtracting the floor value.

- Image-Based Anisotropy Rotation:
  - Formula:
    - Step 1:  vec = (redChannelValue × 2 - 1, greenChannelValue × 2 - 1)
    - Step 2:  angle = atan2(vec.y, vec.x) + rotation
    - Step 3:  normalized_angle = angle / (2 × PI)
    - Step 4:  ASM Rotation = normalized_angle - floor(normalized_angle)
  - Description:
    - Converts red and green channel values to a vector, calculates the angle with an offset rotation, normalizes the angle, and wraps it within the [0, 1] range.

**Export:**

|Material Export|
|--|
diffuseColor → baseColorFactor OR baseColorTexture[rgb]
emissiveColor → emissiveFactor OR emissiveTexture[rgb]
normal → normalTexture[rgb]
occlusion → occlusionTexture[r]
metallic →  metallicFactor OR metallicRoughnessTexture[b]
roughness →  roughnessFactor OR metallicRoughnessTexture[g]
opacity → baseColorTexture[a]
opacityThreshold → alphaCutoff



Export can optionally make use glTF material extensions.

During material export, the ASM shading model is used as an intermediate transport layer.

If the material extensions are turned off, transmission is transcoded into opacity 
to preserve glass and similar translucent materials as best as possible.

Export of node TRS works for animated nodes, but not for static ones at the moment.

Mesh bounding box exported as min and max accessor bounds in glTF.

## File Format Arguments

**Import:**

* `gltfAssetsPath`: Filesystem path where image assets are saved to.
    The default is that image assets are not copied, but the generated usd file will resolve them from the original file.
    The following saves images to the path `myPath` during `UsdStage::Open` and then exports the stage to that same path.
    ```
    UsdStageRefPtr stage = UsdStage::Open("cube.gltf:SDF_FORMAT_ARGS:gltfAssetsPath=myPath")
    stage->Export("myPath/cube.usd")
    ```

**Export:**

* `embedImages` Embed images, as base64 for `gltf` or as binary data for `glb`. Default is `true`.
    The following exports to `glb` and does not embed images:
    ```
    UsdStageRefPtr stage = UsdStage::Open("cube.usd");
    SdfLayer::FileFormatArguments args = { {"embedImages", "false"} };
    stage->Export("cube.glb", false, args);
    ```
* `useMaterialExtensions`: Use glTF material extensions. Default is `true`.

* `gltfAnimationTracks`: Import multiple animation tracks. Default is `false`
    The default is that only the first animation track is imported.
    It is only recommended to use this parameter in order to convert from gltf to another format, such as GLTF.
    It is not recommended to export a .usd file after importing a file with this parameter set.
    ```
    The following allows additional animation tracks to be imported, and adds metadata to USD to encode where
    each track begins and ends. The exporter can then read this metadata to export the tracks properly.
    ```
    UsdStageRefPtr stage = UsdStage::Open("cube.gltf:SDF_FORMAT_ARGS:gltfAnimationTracks=true")
    stage->Export("myPath/cube.gltf")
    ```

## Debug codes
* `FILE_FORMAT_GLTF`: Common debug messages.
* `GLTF_PACKAGE_RESOLVER`: Asset resolution debug messages, when resolving images from the original
  gltf file.
